What is SQL?
It stands for structured query language. It is used for querying and manipulating data and defining structures in databases

Elements of SQL
1. [ ] Queries -used to retrieve data based on specified criteria
2. [ ] Clauses - Components of statements or queries
3. [ ] Predicates - logical conditions that evaluate to true or false(help narrow down the results of queries)
4. [ ] Expressions - these are part of predicates(produce either scalar values or tables(rows and columns))
5. [ ] Statements -comprise of clauses and optionally expressions and predicates
6. [ ] White space - generally ignored and used for formatting  for readability

Database

A collection of interrelated information.

RDMS - relational database management system
Relational databases are highly structured and understand SQL
In RDMS data is organized into tables that hold information about each entity and represent pre-defined categories through rows and columns.
This structured data is both efficient and flexible to access.


* Tables - collection of related data stored in rows and columns
* Fields -intersection of row and column (cell)
* Rows -contains values in a horizontal division of data (record)
* Columns -contains values in a vertical division of data
