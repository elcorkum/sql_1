UNION combines two or more SELECT statements into a single result set
Each SELECT statement of the UNION operator must have similar number of columns
UNION removes duplicate values
UNION ALL keeps the duplicate values
Only one ORDER BY clause can be used  and it sorts the entire result set


We are able to simulate FULL OUTER JOIN by using LEFT and RIGHT JOIN with UNION
